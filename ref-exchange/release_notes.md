1. feature instant swap;  
Allows to swap with a single transaction without needing to deposit / withdraw. Not even storage deposits are required for the pool (inner account not touched). But FE must make sure that receiver is registered in the outgoing token, or they would go to inner account or lost-found account.  
Example usage: 
    ```bash
    contract.ft_transfer_call(
        to_va(swap()),
        to_yocto("1").into(),
        None,
        "{{\"actions\": [{{\"pool_id\": 0, \"token_in\": \"dai\", \"token_out\": \"eth\", \"min_amount_out\": \"1\"}}]}}".to_string()
    ),
    ```  
    Specifically for TokenReceiverMessage message parameters are:  
    ```rust
    enum TokenReceiverMessage {
        /// Alternative to deposit + execute actions call.
        Execute {
            referral_id: Option<ValidAccountId>,
            /// List of sequential actions.
            actions: Vec<Action>,
        },
    }
    ```
    where Action is either SwapAction or any future action added there.
